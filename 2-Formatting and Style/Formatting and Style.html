            This paragraph
            contains      a lot of spaces
            in the source     code,
            but the    browser 
            ignores it.

            Here is an example <br> of a paragraph <br> that moves onto new lines
        </p>

        <!--Alternatively, we can use this : -->

        <pre>
            My Bonnie lies over the ocean.
         
            My Bonnie lies over the sea.
         
            My Bonnie lies over the ocean.
            
            Oh, bring back my Bonnie to me.
         </pre> <!--This basically keeps all formatting - doesn't ignore spaces or line breaks.-->
         

         <!--      Onwards, we have the style attribute. -->
         <!--     <tagname style="property:value;"">       -->
    </body>
    <body style = "background-color:lightpink";> 
        <h1> This is now prettyified.</h1>
